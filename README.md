Source Code
Step 1 (HTML Code):
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our Project.

After creating the files just paste the following codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

Let's break down the HTML code step by step:


Basic Structure:
Creates a webpage celebrating Happy Holi 2024.

Uses HTML for structure and Bootstrap for styling (navigation bar, buttons).

Navigation Bar:
Fixed to the top for easy access.

Links to Home, Contact, About, and a dropdown menu (More).

Main Content:
Large headline ("Hey there!") and a message.

Another animated heading ("Happy Holi!") with a message.

Buttons for "contact" and "Login".

Background Video:
Plays a muted video loop ("Happy Holi 2024 By CWS.mp4").

External Stylesheet (style.css):
Likely defines colors, fonts, and layouts for the website.

This is the basic structure of our tyre-fitting landing page using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.


Step 2 (CSS Code):
"Next, let's enhance the visual appeal of our project by styling it with CSS. We'll make a separate file with a .css file to contain all our styling.


After making the file, just copy and paste the following CSS code into it. Remember to save your CSS document with a .css extension, ensuring it's properly linked to your HTML document for rendering in a web browser.


Let's break down the CSS code step by step:

Resets styles: Makes all elements consistent for easier styling.

Black background: Sets the background of the page to black.

Navigation bar: Positions a navigation bar at the top.
